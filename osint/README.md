# 👁️ OSINT & Reconnaissance

> Open Source Intelligence — gather information from publicly available sources.

> **Grey Hat context:** OSINT is the foundation of every red team engagement (passive recon before touching the target) and is also central to threat intelligence and Blue Team operations (profiling threat actors, pivoting on IOCs, investigating incidents).

## OSINT Mindset

1. Start with what you know (name, username, email, image, domain)
2. Expand outward — every piece of info leads to the next
3. Document everything — links, screenshots, timestamps
4. Stay passive — do not interact with or alert the target

---

## Username & Identity

```bash
# Search username across many platforms
sherlock username
maigret username

# Manual checks
# GitHub: https://github.com/username
# Twitter/X: https://twitter.com/username
# Instagram: https://instagram.com/username
# Reddit: https://reddit.com/u/username
# LinkedIn: search by name
```

---

## Email Investigation

```bash
# Validate if email exists (without sending)
holehe email@example.com     # checks which sites the email is registered on

# WHOIS lookup
whois example.com

# Email header analysis (paste into)
# https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx
# https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/

# Find emails for a domain
theHarvester -d example.com -b all
```

---

## Domain & IP Recon

```bash
# WHOIS
whois example.com
whois 1.2.3.4

# DNS records
nslookup example.com
dig example.com ANY +noall +answer
dig @8.8.8.8 example.com MX

# Reverse DNS
dig -x 1.2.3.4

# Subdomain discovery (passive)
subfinder -d example.com
amass enum -passive -d example.com
# Online: https://dnsdumpster.com, https://crt.sh

# Certificate transparency logs
curl "https://crt.sh/?q=%.example.com&output=json" | python3 -m json.tool

# Shodan (indexed internet devices)
shodan host 1.2.3.4         # requires API key
# Online: https://shodan.io

# Check historical DNS/WHOIS
# https://securitytrails.com
# https://viewdns.info
```

## Web & Content

```bash
# Wayback Machine — archived versions of websites
# https://web.archive.org
waybackurls example.com     # extract all archived URLs

# Google dorking
site:example.com filetype:pdf
site:example.com inurl:admin
site:example.com "confidential"
"@example.com" site:pastebin.com
intitle:"index of" "backup"

# Find cached pages
cache:example.com/page

# GitHub dorking
# https://github.com/search
org:example filename:.env
org:example "password"
org:example "api_key"
```

---

## Image & Geolocation

```bash
# Reverse image search
# https://images.google.com  (drag & drop)
# https://yandex.com/images   (often better for faces/locations)
# https://tineye.com

# Extract image metadata
exiftool image.jpg           # GPS coords, camera model, software, dates

# Convert GPS coords
# DMS: 40°41'21.4"N 74°2'40.2"W
# DD: 40.689278, -74.044500
# → Paste in Google Maps or maps.google.com

# Geolocate from clues in the image
# - Street signs, language
# - Architecture, vegetation
# - Sun angle / shadows
# - GeoGuessr practice helps
```

---

## Social Media Analysis

```bash
# Twitter/X advanced search
# https://twitter.com/search-advanced
# from:username, to:username, geocode:lat,lon,radius, since:2023-01-01

# Facebook Graph Search (still partially works):
# https://www.facebook.com/search/people/?q=John+Doe

# Instagram location tags, tagged photos

# LinkedIn — company employees, job history
# Google dork: site:linkedin.com/in "example company" "engineer"
```

---

## Document & File Metadata

```bash
# PDF metadata
exiftool document.pdf
pdfinfo document.pdf
strings document.pdf | grep -i "author\|creator\|producer"

# Office documents (DOCX/XLSX)
unzip document.docx -d doc_extracted
cat doc_extracted/docProps/core.xml    # author, last modified by, dates

# Image metadata
exiftool image.jpg
# Look for: GPS coords, camera serial, software used, original date
```

---

## Breach Data & Credential Lookup

```bash
# Check if email appears in known breaches
# https://haveibeenpwned.com
# https://dehashed.com  (paid, more detail)
# https://intelx.io

# Paste sites
# https://pastebin.com
# https://paste.ee
# https://ghostbin.com
# Search: site:pastebin.com "target name"
```

---

## People Search

```
# USA
https://www.whitepages.com
https://www.spokeo.com
https://pipl.com

# Public records
https://www.publicrecords.com
County court records, property records, voter registration

# LinkedIn Sales Navigator (profile URL trick)
https://linkedin.com/in/username
```

## CTF-Specific OSINT Tips

- Read challenge text carefully — usernames, dates, locations are often direct clues
- Check challenge author's social media for hints
- Reverse search profile pictures
- Check metadata on all provided files
- Try the Wayback Machine on any given URL
- Look at the page source and HTTP headers of challenge websites
- If given a real-world location clue, use Google Street View
