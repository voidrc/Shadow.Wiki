# GPG

## Install

```bash
sudo pacman -S gnupg
```

---

## Generate a Keypair

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

When prompted:

| Prompt | Recommended value |
|--------|-------------------|
| Key type | `RSA and RSA` (default) |
| Key size | `4096` |
| Expiration | `0` (never) |
| Name / Email | your alias |
| Passphrase | strong and memorized |

---

## Encrypt a File

```bash
gpg --encrypt --recipient "user" file.txt
```

Output is `file.txt.gpg` — unreadable without the private key.

---

## Decrypt a File

```bash
gpg --decrypt file.txt.gpg > file.txt
```

---

## Key Management

List keys:

```bash
gpg --list-keys          # public keys
gpg --list-secret-keys   # private keys
```

Export public key (to share):

```bash
gpg --export --armor "user" > user_public.asc
```

Backup private key (keep offline — USB or paper):

```bash
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor "user" > user_private.asc
```

---

## Sign a File

Prove a file came from you:

```bash
gpg --sign file.txt          # binary signature embedded
gpg --clearsign file.txt     # human-readable signed output
gpg --detach-sign file.txt   # separate .sig file
```

Verify a signature:

```bash
gpg --verify file.txt.sig file.txt
```

---

## Notes

- Even if your files are stolen, they are unreadable without the private key.
- Store key backups offline (USB + printed copy as last resort).
- Practice encrypting and decrypting dummy files until it is second nature.
